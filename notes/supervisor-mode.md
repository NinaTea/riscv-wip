## Supervisor-Level (S-mode) ISA v1.12

RISC-V supports Page-Based 32-bit, 39-bit, and 48-bit virtual memory addressing. Kiiii 39 wtf.

The supervisor (S-Mode) memory-management fence instruction (SFENCE.VMA) is used to synchronize updates to in-memory memory-management data structures with current execution.
